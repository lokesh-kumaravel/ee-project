    <h2>Varities</h2>
    <p>PKM 1,CO.1 ,CO.2 ,CO.3 , (Marutham) and Paiyur 1</p><br>
    <h2>Hybrids</h2>
    <p>COTH.1 ,COTH 2 and TNAU Tomato Hybrid CO 3</p><br>
    <h2>Soil</h2>
    <p>Well drained loamy soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.5-7.5.</p>
    <h2>Season of sowing</h2>
    <p>May - June and November-December</p>
    <h2>Nursery bed preparation</h2>
    <p>Apply FYM 10 kg, Neem cake 1 kg, VAM 50 g, enriched Superphosphate 100 g and Furadon 10 g per square meter before
        sowing.</p>
    <h2>Seed rate</h2>
    <p>Varieties : 300-350 g / ha
        Hybrids : 100-150 g / ha</p>
    <h2>Seed treatment</h2>
    <p>Treat the seeds with Trichoderma viride 4 g or Pseudomonas fluorescens 10 g or Carbendazim 2 g per kg of seeds 24
        hours before sowing. Just before sowing, treat the seeds with Azospirillum @ 40 g / 400 g of seeds. Sow in lines
        at 10 cm apart in raised nursery beds and cover with sand.</p>
    <h2>Protected nursery</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Prepare the nursery area of 3 cents with slanting slope of 2 % for the seedling production to cover 1 ha.
        </li>
        <li>Cover the nursery area with 50 % shade net and cover the sides using 40/50 mesh insect proof nylon net.</li>
        <li>Form raised beds of 1 m width and convenient length and place HDPV pipes at 2m interval for further
            protection with polythene sheets during rainy months.</li>
        <li>Mix sterilized cocopeat @ 300 kg with 5 kg neem cake along with Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria each @ 1
            kg. Approximately 1.2 kg of cocopeat is required for filling one protray. 238 protrays (98 cells) are
            required for the production of 23,334 seedlings, which are required for one hectare adopting a spacing of 90
            x 60 x 60 cm in paired row system.</li>
        <li>Sow the treated seed in protrays @ one seed per cell.
        <li> Cover the seed with cocopeat and keep the trays one above the other and cover with a polythene sheet till
            germination starts</li>
        <li>After six days, place the protrays with germinated seeds individually on the raised beds inside the shade
            net</li>
        <li>Water with rosecan everyday and drench with NPK 19:19:19 @ 0.5% (5g/l) at 18 days after sowing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Transplanting </h2>
    <p>Before transplanting plant in the felid treat with a fungicide like bavistin and humic acid.</p>
    <p>If transplanting is done in the rainy season then maintain spacing 75 x 60 cm and summer season, 75 x 45 cm.</p>
    <p>If you are using drip irrigation method for tomato crop, then transplanting is to be done in paired row system
        with the spacing of 50 cm x 50 cm.</p>
    <h2>Fertilizers And Manure</h2>
    <p>At the time of land preparation, broadcast and thoroughly mix the well-decomposed FYM at 20 to 25 t/ha in the
        soil</p>
    <p>Then add a basal fertilizer dose Nitrogen – 60 kg, Phosphorus – 80 kg and Potash -60 kg Potash per hectare.</p>
    <p>After 30 to 45 days of planting, give 30 kg amount of nitrogen to the crop.</p>
    <h2>Supporting Tomato Plants (Staking)</h2>
    <center><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Raj-124.jpg" width="500" height="350">
    </center>
    <p>The long growing varieties of tomatoes need to be specially supported. At the time of plant growth, plants should
        be staking with the help of string or wire.</p>
    <p>With the help of this support, fruits cannot expose to soil and water; hence there is no problem of tomato fruit
        rotting so that more production can be obtained.</p>
    <h2>Irrigation For Tomato Crop</h2>
    <p>To get maximum yield from tomato crop, use drip irrigation method. During summer give water 6-7-day intervals and
        in winter season give water after of 10-15 days.</p>
    <p>If possible, use drip irrigation. With the help of this irrigation method, you can able to save about 60-70
        percent of the water and increase 20%-25% more production.</p>
    <h2>Weed Control</h2>
    <p>First weeding operation star after 20 to 25 days of transplanting. Always maintain clean and weed free farm
        because weed competes with crop also they provide shelter to the various harmful insect. You may use organic
        herbicides to aid in weed control but beware of toxic ones similar to those mentioned in the Paraquat lawsuit.
    </p>
    <p><b>Mulching</b>is also good option control weed after black plastic (50 microns) mulching is mostly used which
        controls about 95% weeds.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, you can use organic mulch like sugar cane trash, which controls about 60% of weeds.</p>
    <h2>Harvesting</h2>
    <center><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tomatoes-101845_1280.jpg" width="500"
            height="350"></center>
    <p>The first harvesting of plants usually starts in 75 to 90 days from planting. While Considering the market
        distance and transport mode, tomato fruits should be harvest as follows.</p>
    <b>1) Green stage:</b>
    <p>If you are sending tomato fruit for long distant market, then harvest at Maturity stage with green colour .</p>
    <b>2) pink stage:</b>
    <p>The tomato should be harvested by changing the color of the green color to the pinkish appeared. It is better to
        send such fruits to nearby markets.</p>
    <b>3) Maturity stage:</b>
    <p>To sell tomato in the local market, harvest after the fruit is reddish on the tree.</p>
    <b>4)) Full maturity:</b>
    <p>In this state, the fruit is fully reddish and slightly red on the tree. Such fruits are useful to make durable
        materials such as ketchup, sauce, soup, chutney, etc.</p>
    <p>After removing the fruit, grading the fruit, packing it in the corrugated boxes.</p>
    <h2>Production</h2>
    <p>The average hectare production of tomatoes is 250 to 400 quintal. The production of up to 750-800 quintals of
        hectare can be achieved due to excellent cultivation.</p>
    <h2>Crop Protection</h2>
    <h3>Pest</h3>
    <h2>1) Fruit Borer</h2>
    <center><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/1.jpg" width="350" height="300"></center>
    <p>Female kite lay eggs on flowers. After leaving the egg, the larvae start to eat leaves. After that, they start to
        eaten fruit. The larvae put holes in the fruit and put half of the body in the fruit. This pest could damage
        40%-50%of fruits production</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Marigold as a trap crop with the help of this trap early pest attack detection is possible which is very
            helpful for the Effective management</li>
        <li>sprays of Ha NPV viruses after 42 days of transplanting.</li>
        <li>At periodic intervals (3-4 times) mechanical collection and destruction of Fruit Borer</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2 ) Whiteflies </h2>
    <p>Whitefly is a very harmful pest on tomato; it is responsible for transmits leaf curl virus. It sucks food form
        leave, so deformation of young leaves observes. Whiteflies also excrete honeydew, causing sooty mold.</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>use yellow stick trap for early attack detection</li>
        <li>After transplanting give need-based sprays of Imidacloprid 20 SL (0.3ml/l) after 15 days of planting and do
            not repeat after the fruiting stage as this may leave harmful residues in fruits.</li>
        <li>If the traps indicate the whitefly activity, spray Dimethoate 30EC at 2ml/liter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3) Leafminer</h2>
    <center><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Leafminer.jpg" width="500" height="350">
    </center>
    <p>It is a serious and a polyphagous pest of the tomato crop. Maggot ( larva) form mines between two epidermal
        layers of the leaf and make serpentine mines. Extensive leaf mining activity reduces the photosynthetic process
        of plants, resulting in defoliation and produce unmarketable fruits.</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>observe and remove infected leaves at the time of planting or within a week of transplanting</li>
        <li>Apply neem cake in the field 250 kg/ha at planting and repeat this operation after 25 days.</li>
        <li>Spray neem seed powder extract 4%</li>
        <li>if the incidence is high, then remove infected leaves and spray Triazophos 40 EC (1ml)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4) Root-Knot Nematodes</h2>
    <p>This affects the uptake capacity of nutrition and water of the plants. This causes stunted plants with yellow
        foliage resulting in yield reduction.</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Use nematode resistant variety</li>
        <li>Follow crop rotation with marigold crop</li>
        <li>use seed treatment</li>
        <li>if possible soil carried out soil solarisation process.</li>
        <li>Apply Carbofuran 3G at 1 kg ai/ha at transplanting.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disease</h2>
    <h2>1) Alternaria Blight</h2><br>
    <center>
        <table>
            <tr><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg"width="500" height="350"></tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <b>Symptoms</b>
    <p>Irregular leaf spots mostly appear from the marginal portion of leaves. Mostly these disease appears in the
        vegetative growth phase of the plant and before flowering. Symptoms of early blight appear on all above ground
        parts of the plant</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Always use healthy and certified seeds collected from the disease-free area.
        </li>
        <li>Infected crop debris and fruits must be collected from the field and burnt.</li>
        <li>Summer plowing to increase the desiccation of pathogen and infected plant parts.</li>
        <li>Minimize relative humidity in plant canopy for preventing the infection.</li>
        <li>sprays of Chlorothalonil at 0.2% at 8 days interval</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2) Powdery Mildew</h2>
   <center> <img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/powdery-mildew.jpg"width="500" height="350"></center>
    <p>powdery mildew infection appeared as white, chalky spots on leaves. They spread rapidly on infected leaves. The
        leaves turned yellow, died and drop off.</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>If the disease occurs, then 0.25% sulphur mixed with water spray 25 gm in 10 liters of water 2-3 times in
            intervals in 10 days.</li>
        <li>To control it, spray 10 grams of Bavistin mixed in 10 liters of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3)Late Blight</h2>
    <p>Disease on leaves, appear as pale green irregular spots that turn into purplish brown and later become nearly
        black. Margins of the spots were pale green to water soaked.</p>
    <p>Infected fruits showed characteristic brown to purple discoloration, often concentrated on the sides or upper
        fruit surface</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Use and planting material from the disease-free area.</li>
        <li>maintain field Sanitation.</li>
        <li>Staking of plants which reduce Fruit touches chance to the ground</li>
        <li>In cloudy condition take Preventive sprays of Mancozeb 75% WP at 0.25% (2.5 gm per liter water) take this
            spray after 5 to 7 days interval.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4) Leaf Curl Complex</h2>
    <center><img src="https://agricultureguruji.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Leaf-Curl-Complex.jpg"width="500" height="350"></center>
    <p>Virus-transmitted by whitefly as well as by mechanical injury. this Disease mostly appears in September to
        November month. Plants show stunted growth with downward rolling, curling, twisting and chlorosis leaves</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>maintain field Sanitation don’t all to grow weeds.</li>
        <li>Use of yellow sticky cards to evacuate whitefly attack</li>
        <li>Spray Dimethoate 30% EC at 396 ml in 200-400 l of water/acre</li>
        <li>Spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 60-70 ml in 200 l of water/acre or Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 80 g in 200 l of
            water/acre.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>5) Damping-off</h2>
    <p>In pre-emergence phage, the young seedlings die before they reach the surface of the soil and post-emergence
        Infection usually occurs near to the soil level and the infected plant tissues appear soft and water-soaked.</p>
    <p>As the disease In advances stage the stems become weak and collapse.</p>
    <b>Management</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoid poorly drained soil for tomato cultivation</li>
        <li>Use raised beds technique for better water drainage alsouse plastic -trays for raising seedlings</li>
        <li>Seed treated with captan 75% WP at 20-30 g/Kg seed</li>
        <li>Drench solution of Metalxyl 8% and Mancozeb 64% WP at 2 g/ liter of water in the nursery.</li>
