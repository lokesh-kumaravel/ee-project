    <h2>Main Field Preparation for Planting Sugarcane</h2>
    <h2>1. Preparation of Field</h2>
    <h2>a) Wetland (Heavy soils): </h2>
    <p> -->In wetlands, preparatory cultivation by ploughing the land and bringing the soil to fine tilth could not be done.</p>
    <p>-->After harvest of the paddy crop, form irrigation and drainage channels of 40 cm depth and 30 cm width at intervals of 6 m across the field and along the field borders.</p>
    <p>-->Form ridges and furrows with a spacing of 80 cm between rows with spade.</p>
    <p>-->Stir the furrows with hand hoes and allow the soil to weather for 4 to 5 days.</p>
    <h2>b) Problem soils with excessive soil moisture:</h2>
    <p>-->In problem soils, with excessive moisture where it is difficult to drain water, form raised beds at 30 cm intervals with Length - 5 m, Width - 80 cm, and Height -15 cm.</p><br>
    <h2>Garden lands with medium and light soils:</h2>
    <p> In medium and light soil irrigated by flow or lift irrigation adopt the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The initial ploughing with two disc plough followed by eight disc plough and using cultivator for deep ploughing followed by one time operation of rotovator to pulverize the soil to get a fine tilth, free of weeds and stubbles.
        </li>
        <li>Level the field for proper irrigation.</li>
        <li>Open ridges and furrows at 80 cm apart with the help of victory plough or tractor drawn ridger. The depth of furrow must be 20 cm.</li>
           <li>Open irrigation channels at 10 m intervals.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>2. Basal application of organic manures:</h2>
    <p>Apply FYM at 12.5 t/ha or compost 25 t/ha or filter press mud at 37.5 t/ha before the last ploughing under gardenland conditions. In wetlands this may be applied along the furrows and incorporated well.</p>
    <h2>Preparation of reinforced compost from sugarcane trash and pressmud:</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spread the sugarcane trash to a thickness of 15 cm over an area of 7 m x 3 m. Then apply pressmud over this trash to a thickness of 5 cm.  Sprinkle the fertilizer mixture containing mussoorie rock phosphate, gypsum and urea in the ratio of 2:2:1 over these layers at the rate of 5 kg/100 kg of trash. Moist the trash and pressmud layers adequately with water.</li>
            <li>Repeat this process till the entire heap rises to a height of 1.5 m. Use cowdung slurry instead of water to moist the layer wherever it is available. Cover the heap with a layer of soil and pressmud at 1:1 ratio to a thickness of 15 cm.</li>
            <li>Leave the heap as such for three months for decomposition. Moist the heap once in 15 days. During rainy season, avoid moistening the heap. After three months, turn and mix the heap thoroughly and form a heap and leave it for one more month. Then turn and mix the heap thoroughly at the end of the fourth month. Moist the heap once in 15 days during 4th and 5th month also. This method increases the manurial value of trash compost by increasing, N, P and Ca content. It also brings down the C:N ratio by 10 times as compared to raw cane trash.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2><center>Management Of Main Field Operations</center></h2>
            <h2>1.Preparation Of Setts For Planting</h2>
            <p>Take seed material from short crop (6 to 7 months age) free from pests and diseases incidence.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detrash the cane with hand before setts preparation.</li>
                <li>Use sharp knife or sett cutting machine developed by TNAU to prepare setts without splits.</li>
                <li>Discard setts with damaged buds, sprouted buds, splits etc.</li>
                <li>Sett treatment with Azospirillum: Prepare the slurry with 10 packets (2000 g)/ha of Azospirillum inoculum with sufficient water and soak the setts in the slurry for 15 minutes before planting.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>2. Sett Treatment</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Select healthy setts for planting.</li>
                <li>The setts should be soaked in 100 litres of water dissolved with 50g Carbendazim, 200ml malathion and 1 kg urea for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Treat setts with Aerated steam at 50°C for one hour to control primary infection of grassy shoot disease.</li>

            <p>Different systems of planting is not found to influence the millable cane population, commercial cane sugar per cent, cane and sugar yield.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Irrigate the furrows to form a slurry in wet land condition (Heavy soil)</li>
                <li>Place the setts along the centre of the furrows, accommodating 12 buds/metre length.    Keep the buds in the lateral position and press gently beneath the soil in the furrow.Avoid exposure of setts to sunlight.
                </li>
                <li>Plant more setts near the channel or double row planting at every 10th row for gap filling, at later stage.In dry/ garden land dry method of planting may be followed.  First arrange the setts along the furrows, cover the setts with soil and then irrigate.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Planting Methods of Sugarcane</h2>
            <p>Basically ,there are 4 planting methods in sugarcane farming which are described below:</p>
            <h2>Ridge and Furrow Method</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the most common method of sugrcane planting followed in maharashtra</li>
                <li>in this method , the ridges and furrows are opened with the help of rider by keeping 120cm distance between furrows in heavy soil and 10 cm distance in light to medium soil</li>
                <li>main and sub-irrigation channelsare opened at an appropriate distance</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>5. Filling up gaps</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Fill the gaps, if any, within 30 days after planting with sprouted setts.</li>
              <li>Gap filling with two budded setts/ poly bag seedlings within 15 to 20 days after planting to maintain optimum plant stand.</li>
              <li>Maintain adequate moisture for 3 weeks for proper establishment of the sprouted  setts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>6.Trash Mulching</h2>
            <p>Mulch the ridges uniformly with cane trash to a thickness of 10 cm within a week after planting.  It helps to tide over drought, conserves moisture, reduce weed population and minimise shoot borer incidence.  Mulch the field with trash after 21 days of planting in heavy soil and wetland conditions. Avoid trash mulching in areas where incidence of termites is noticed.</p>
            <h2>7. Raising Inter crops</h2>
            <p>In areas of adequate irrigation, sow one row of soybean or blackgram or greengram along the centre of the ridge on the 3rd day of planting. Intercropping of daincha or sunhemp along ridges and incorporation of the same on the 45th day during partial earthing up helps to increase the soil fertility, and also the cane yield. Especially Intercropping of Co.1 Soybean gives an yield of 800 kg/ha without any adverse effect on cane yield.</p>
            <h2>8. Weed Management</h2>
            <h3>Weed Management in pure crop of Sugarcane</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Wherever weed menace is higher, one line weeding along the crop row and spade digging of ridges have to be done on 30, 60 and 90 DAP</li>
              <li>Spray Atrazine 2 kg or Oxyflurofen 750 ml/ha mixed in 600 liters of water as pre emergence herbicide on the 3rd day of planting, using deflector or fan type nozzle fitted with knapsack sprayer.</li>
              <li>The pre emergence application of atrazine @ 1.0 kg a.i. ha-1 on 3 DAP followed by post emergence directed application of glyphosate @ 1.0 lit ha-1on 45 DAP with hood+ one hand weeding on 90 DAP registered the maximum cane yield.</li>
              <li>If pre-emergence spray is not carried out, go in for post-emergence spray of Grammaxone litre + 2,4-D sodium salt 2.5 kg/ha in 600 liter of water on 21st day of planting.</li>
              <li>If the parasitic weed striga is a problem, post-emergence application of 2,4-D sodium salt @ kg/ha in 500 litre of water/ha may be done. 2, 4-D spraying should be avoided when neighbouring crop is cotton or bhendi. Apply 20% urea also for the control of striga as direct spray.</li>
              <li>Pre- plant application of glyphosate at 2.0 kg ha-1 along with 2% ammonium sulphate at 21 days before planting of sugarcane followed by post emergence direct spraying of glyphosate at 2.0 kg ha-1 along with 2% ammonium sulphate with a special hood on 30 DAP suppressed the nut sedges (Cyperus rotandus) and provided weed free environment.</li>
              <li>If herbicide is not applied work the junior-hoe along the ridges on 25, 55 and 85 days after planting for removal of weeds and proper stirring. Remove the weeds along the furrows with hand hoe. Otherwise operate power tiller fitted with tynes for intercultivation.</li>
              <li>Control of creeper weeds post emergence directed application of fernoxone (2, 4 –D sodium salt) @ 2 gm + 10 gm of urea per liter of water may be sprayed over the creeper weeds.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Weed management in Sugarcane intercropping system</h2>
            <p>Premergence application of Thiobencarb @ 1.25 kg ai/ha under intercropping system in Sugarcane with Soybean, blackgram or groundnut gives effective weed control. Raising intercrops is not found to affect the cane yield and quality.</p>
            <h2>9. Earthing Up</h2>
            <p>After application of 3rd dose fertilizer (90 days), work victory plough along the ridges for efficient and economical earthing up. At 150 days after planting, earthing up may be done with spade.</p>
            <h2>10. Detrashing</h2>
            <p>Remove the dry cane leaves on 150th and 210th day to avoid borer infestation.</p>

          <h2>11. Propping</h2>
          <p>Do double line propping with trash twist at the age of 210 days of the crop.</p>
          <h2>12. Harvesting</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Early varieties have to be harvested at 10 to 11 months age and mid-season varieties at 11 to 12 months age.</li>
            <li>Harvest the cane at peak maturity. Cut the cane to the ground level for both plant and ratoon crops.</li>
