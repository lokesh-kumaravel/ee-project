                    Only 7-8 kg of seed is required to plant 1 ha.</li>

                <li>Spread polythene sheets over the beds evenly.</li>
                <li>Fill the soil evenly over the Polythene sheets upto 4cm.</li>
                <li>Uniformly spread 375 g of seeds in each 5 sq.m. nursery bed.</li>

                        <li>Water management is one of the critical steps in paddy cultivation.</li>
                        <li>Plants with truncated roots cannot access the residual soil moisture in lower horizons that
                            is accessible to plants which have large and functioning roots systems to maintain their
                            growth and productivity.</li>
                        <li>Hence, alternate wetting and drying is advocated.
                            Irrigation only to moist the soil in the early period of 10 days.</li>
                        <li>Restoring irrigation to a maximum depth of 2.5cm after development of hairline cracks in the
                            soil until panicle initiation.</li>
                        <li>Increasing irrigation depth to 5.0 cm after Panicle initiation one day after disappearance
                            of ponded water.</li>

                    <h3>1.PLANING METHODS</h3>
                    <p>There are 3 methods of planting upland rice namely; Drill, Dibble, Broadcast.
                        Drilling and Dibbling allow straight row planting that ensures optimum plant
                        population and use of a hoe for weeding. Straight row planting can be achieved
                        by using a planting rope or using line markers</p>
                    <br>

                            height="300"></center>
                        <h3>2.SOWING DEPTH</h3>
                        <p>It is recommended that upland rice be planted at a depth of between 3 - 4 cm.
                            Planting at a depth of more than 5 cm has been observed to result in low
                            germination, delayed emergence, delayed maturity and thus low yields.
                        </p><br>
                        <h3>3.REFILLING OF MISSING HILLS</h3>
                        <p>Missing hills lead to low yield. It is therefore advisable that you set a small
                            nursery bed beside the mother garden to raise seedlings for purposes of refilling
                            gaps. Gap filling should be done 15-20 days after sowing and itâ€™s important to
                            water the seedlings after transplanting</p><br>
                        <h3>4.FERTILIZATION</h3>
                        <p>Rice should not be continuously grown on the same fields, it should be rotated
                            with other crops to conserve soil fertility.
                            Composted organic material such as rice straw and animal manure can be added
                            to the soil to supplement soil fertility.</p><br>

                                        src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/55/fd/0b/55fd0bb0c3d22ae132db4f117b285ef7.jpg"

                                    <h3>Harvesting</h3>
                                    <p>The stem of the rice is cut close to the ground by serrated sickles. This method
                                        of harvesting is much faster than harvesting by panicle using a knife.
                                        Harvesting
                                        should be done when 80-85% of the grains are straw coloured and the grains in
                                        the lower part of the panicle are in the hard dough stage.</p>
                                    <h3>Threshing</h3>
                                    <p>Threshing can be done by beating with sticks against a log or using thresher.
                                        However, threshing by beating increases the chances of broken grains at milling.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Winnowing and Drying</h3>
                                    <p>Before drying, winnow empty grains
                                        and straw away.
                                        Open air drying under the hot sun heat
                                        is widely practiced in the tropics.
                                        Preferably drying should be done on
                                        a tarpaulin or a clean drying floor
                                        free of stones.
                                        The rice should be 4 - 5 cm thick and needs to be turned over 30-60 minutes to
                                        allow equal exposure to the sun heat. Its important to monitor moisture
                                        reductions, less than 3% reductions are recommended per day.
                                        Rapid drying lead to broken rice when milling. DRY SLOWLY!</p>
